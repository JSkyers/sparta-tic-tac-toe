# Sparta Tic Tac Toe

We were tasked with making a tic tac toe simulator using jquery.

What made this challenge difficult was that we were not allowed to edit neither the HTML or the CSS.

I used several if statements to accompany jquery as it made the task a bit easier.

The hardest part was defining the win conditions but in the end it required several comparisons amongst several values.

I hope to learn ways to both shorten the amount of code necessary and make the code easier to read for an outsider.
